Let me get one thing straight - Austin Kleon's 'Show Your Work!' has been rattling around in my brain like a catchy pop song for months now. You know the type - it's 3 AM, you're trying to sleep, and all you can hear is 'share your work, share your work.' It's like a mantra, a chant, a nagging parent reminding you to clean your room. but instead of dirty laundry, it's all about airing our your knowledge and learning for the world to see.

I know what you are thinking - "That book's been out for years, why are you just now deciding to write about it?" Well, I read it couple of months back and I have been meaning to write this article for months now. And let me tell you, it's not for lack of trying. But every time I sat down to write, I'd get this nagging feeling like I was about to jump off a high dive. Scary stuff, right? But then, as I was tinkering around with my website (shout out to the [Hugo Theme - Winston](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme)), I stumbled upon this gem: "You don't start out writing good stuff." And I thought, "Well, isn't that just the permission slip I needed to dive headfirst into the pool of mediocrity."
