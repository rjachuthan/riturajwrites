      <p>Let me get one thing straight - <a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon">Austin Kleon</a>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Show Your Work!&rsquo; has been rattling around in my brain like a catchy pop song for months now. You know the type - it&rsquo;s 3 AM, you&rsquo;re trying to sleep, and all you can hear is &lsquo;share your work, share your work.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like a mantra, a chant, a nagging parent reminding you to clean your room. but instead of dirty laundry, it&rsquo;s all about airing our your knowledge and learning for the world to see.</p>
<p>I know what you are thinking - &ldquo;That book&rsquo;s been out for years, why are you just now deciding to write about it?&rdquo; Well, I read it couple of months back and I have been meaning to write this article for months now. And let me tell you, it&rsquo;s not for lack of trying. But every time I sat down to write, I&rsquo;d get this nagging feeling like I was about to jump off a high dive. Scary stuff, right? But then, as I was tinkering around with my website (shout out to the <a href="https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme">Hugo Theme - Winston</a>), I stumbled upon this gem: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t start out writing good stuff.&rdquo; And I thought, &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that just the permission slip I needed to dive headfirst into the pool of mediocrity.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="so-how-is-the-book">So, How is the Book?</h1>
<p>Kevin Kelly once said, &lsquo;<em>The Internet is a copy machine. Once anything that can be copied is brought into contact with the Internet, it will be copied, and those copies never leave.</em>&rsquo; After reading &lsquo;Show Your Work!&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m starting to think books are getting in on the copy action too. And would you believe it? I stumbled upon Kevin&rsquo;s nugget of wisdom right there in the pages of this very book. It&rsquo;s like a game of intellectual tag, where one book quotes another, which quotes another.</p>
<p>While &lsquo;Show Your Work!&rsquo; may not be the treasure trove of never-before-seen wisdom some might have hoped for, it does something arguably more valuable. It takes those scattered pearls of wisdom we&rsquo;ve all stumbled upon at some point of our lives and weaves them into a compelling read. Austin Kleon, doesn&rsquo;t just present these ideas; he nudges, and sometimes outright shoves you towards action. He encourages you to take your work, whatever it may be, and share it with the world. He wants you to doodle a stick figure fighting the lamest war on a paper napkin during lunch and post it on Instagram with a hashtag <code>#NapkinArt</code>. He wants your to write the crappiest piece of code, then kind that would make a seasoned developer cry, and just push it on an Open Source Project on GitHub. He&rsquo;d probably cheer you on if you recorded a tuneless rendition of &lsquo;Happy birthday&rsquo; on your old, out-of-tune piano and uploaded it to YouTube. Heck, he might even advocate for you to choreograph a dance routine to the sound of your morning alarm and debut it on Insta Reels or TikTok. It&rsquo;s all about putting yourself out there, no matter how messy, imperfect, or downright bizzare your work might be.</p>
<h1 id="what-did-i-like-about-the-book">What Did I Like About the Book?</h1>
<p>There were several standout points that resonated with me, and offered a fresh perspective on how to approach my work. Out of all the ideas, these are summaries of the three most important points I am taking away from this book:</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-have-to-be-a-genius">You Don&rsquo;t Have to Be a Genius</h2>
<p>This book debunks the myth of the lone genius. The idea that you have to be a genius to create something of value is not only intimidating but also misleading. In reality, everyone has something unique to offer, and it&rsquo;s about tapping into that potential and sharing it with the world. The book encourages embracing the role of the amateur, the one who loves what they do and is not afraid to experiment, make mistakes, and learn along the way.</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;Scenius&rdquo; is another powerful idea from the book. It suggests that great ideas are often born from a community of creative individuals. Finding your &ldquo;Scenius&rdquo; means surrounding yourself with like-minded people who can challenge you, inspire you, and help you grow. It&rsquo;s about recognizing the value of collective intelligence and the power of community in driving creativity and innovation.</p>
<h2 id="think-about-the-process-and-share-something-small-everyday">Think About the Process and Share Something Small Everyday</h2>
<p>Austin places a strong emphasis on the process rather than the final product. And not Austin, several gurus in the industry does emphasise on the process. Documenting and sharing your process can be a powerful tool for learning and growth. It allows you to reflect on your progress, gain valuable feedback, and connect with others who might be on a similar journey.</p>
<p>The idea of sharing something small every day is a practical way of putting this into action. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a finished product or a groundbreaking idea. It could be a snippet of code, a sketch, a thought, or a question. The act of sharing regularly not only helps you maintain momentum but also allows others to see and engage with your work in progress.</p>
<h2 id="open-up-your-can-of-curiosities">Open up Your Can of Curiosities</h2>
<p>This means sharing your interests, your inspirations, and the things that make you tick. It&rsquo;s about letting people see what excites you, what you&rsquo;re passionate about, and what influences your work. This can create a deeper connection with your audience and can also inspire others to explore their own curiosities.</p>
<p>Hoarding knowledge or ideas can stifle creativity and prevent the free flow of information that is so crucial in a creative community. By sharing what you know and learn, you&rsquo;re contributing to the collective knowledge of your &ldquo;Scenius&rdquo; and creating a culture of generosity and collaboration.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Despite its lack of groundbreaking revelations, I&rsquo;d still give &lsquo;Show Your Work!&rsquo; a hearty thumbs up. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t just tell you to create an online presence, it makes a compelling case for why you should. It&rsquo;s a book that deserves at least one read-through, because if you let it, it can shift your perspective and maybe, just maybe, inspire you to take that leap into the digital unknown.</p>
