But before we do, let\u0026rsquo;s set the stage with a bit of context on the Data Engineering Process.\nTraditional data engineering is a complex and intricate process. It involves creating and maintaining architectures, databases, and processing systems that deal with vast amounts of data. Think of Data Engineers as the architects of data. They build pipelines that transform and transport data into a format that can be used by data scientists. They are the ones who ensure the data is clean, reliable, and prepped for analysis. But this process is often time-consuming and requires a high level of technical expertise, which hampers the Development Workflow.\nEnter Low-Code No-Code, an innovation in Data Engineering. I believe that this approach can simplify the process of data integration and processing. It allows individuals without a deep technical background to build and manage data pipelines. With a no-code platform, you can design your data workflows visually and automate the data pipeline without writing a single line of code. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a magic wand that turns complex data tasks into a series of simple, intuitive steps.\nNow, you might be wondering why I, a humble blogger, decided to embark on the journey of creating a No Code Data Engineering platform. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s simple. I saw the challenges that traditional data engineering posed and I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to democratize data engineering by making it accesible to all. But, as with all great endeavors, there were bumps along the road. I faced failures and there were times when I wanted to throw in the towel. But every failure was a lesson learned and every setback, a stepping stone towards progress.\nWhy Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering? # Why are Companies Moving Towards a Low-Code/No-Code Approach for Data Engineering? # Firstly, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the Democratization of technology. Both low-code and no-code solutions are built with the objective of empowering different kinds of users. As IBM puts it, these platforms are designed to make technology accessible to a wider audience, not just those with extensive coding skills. The importance of democratizing technology lies in its potential to foster widespread innovation, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities. By breaking down the barriers of technical complexity, these platforms enable a more diverse pool of minds to engage in technological exploration. A Javascript Developer, a newbie IT Analyst, and individuals with non-technical backgrounds can now actively contribute to the development of innovative solutions without the need for extensive coding knowledge. This democratization nurtures a culture of collaboration and inclusivity, where ideas from various perspectives converge, leading to the emergence of novel applications and cutting-edge advancements. This shift is breaking down barriers between technical and non-technical personnel. I\u0026rsquo;ve always held the belief that a product cannot truly succeed unless business users take an active interest in their IT solutions. In the context of data engineering, this perspective becomes even more crucial.\nAnother reason for choosing a low-code/no-code platform is the speed and efficiency it offers. As Zapier points out, no-code development is the fastest way to build and create solutions. It\u0026rsquo;s also the most cost-effective and easiest to maintain over time. Using this framework which we have built, one of our junior developer has significantly improved his development speed. He has been delivering pipelines at a phenomenal speed.\nMy Reasons for Moving to Low-Code/No-Code Setup # Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re part of a relay race. You\u0026rsquo;re running at breakneck speed, passing the baton, and just when you think you\u0026rsquo;re about to cross the finish line, you\u0026rsquo;re told to run the race again, but this time, backwards. That\u0026rsquo;s what it feels like working in our fast-paced environment. We\u0026rsquo;re juggling data gathering, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model creation, and oh, did I mention, we\u0026rsquo;re also expected to whip up a high-quality data pipeline in the same breath? No extensions. It\u0026rsquo;s like being asked to bake a cake while simultaneously performing a ballet. And guess what? 80-90% of our time is spent on tasks that have nothing to do with data engineering.\nIn the midst of this whirlwind, we often find ourselves creating what I like to call the \u0026lsquo;Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s Monster\u0026rsquo; of code. It\u0026rsquo;s either a \u0026lsquo; God Object\u0026rsquo;, a class that\u0026rsquo;s bitten off more than it can chew, a \u0026lsquo; Spaghetti Code\u0026rsquo;, a tangled mess that\u0026rsquo;s as flexible as a brick, or a big \u0026lsquo; Ball of Mud\u0026rsquo;, a code so convoluted that even Sherlock Holmes would have a hard time deciphering it. And these aren\u0026rsquo;t just fancy terms I\u0026rsquo;m throwing around; they\u0026rsquo;re real Anti-Design Patterns that haunt our deliverables.\nThis is how a God Object works Now, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the wild west of coding styles in our company. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s a cowboy, riding their own horse, following their own trail. It\u0026rsquo;s like trying to understand an orchestra where every musician is playing a different tune. It\u0026rsquo;s a nightmare for our Lead Engineers and Architects who have to review these \u0026lsquo;masterpieces\u0026rsquo;.\nAnd then there\u0026rsquo;s the issue of standardization, or rather, the lack of it. It\u0026rsquo;s like everyone\u0026rsquo;s cooking their own version of a classic recipe. Take \u0026lsquo; Base Price\u0026rsquo; in Media/Marketing Mix Modeling, for example. You\u0026rsquo;d think it\u0026rsquo;s a standard calculation, right? Wrong. Every team has their own secret sauce, which works great for their dish but falls flat in others.\nLastly, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the elephant in the room - good coding practices. Or in our case, the lack thereof. It\u0026rsquo;s like everyone\u0026rsquo;s so busy juggling, they\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to check if the balls they\u0026rsquo;re juggling are even round. Unit testing? What\u0026rsquo;s that? We\u0026rsquo;re so caught up in writing functions for specific tasks that we\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to make them reusable, let alone testable.\nSo, these are my main pain points. It\u0026rsquo;s a wild ride, but hey, who said data engineering was going to be a walk in the park? I would really like to have a Clean Code book just for Data Engineering/Data Science.\nDesired Features from the Framework # Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re handed a magic wand that can transform complex data engineering tasks into a walk in the park. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I envisioned when I set out to create this Framework. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a peek into the magic box of features I had in mind.\nUser-Friendly Interface and Configuration-Driven Design # The first thing I wanted to conjure up with my magic wand was a user-friendly interface. I decided to start with the heart of the system - the code packages. The idea was to create a robust foundation first and then wrap it up with a pretty bow, aka the User Interface. The entire data engineering pipeline was to be defined as a configuration file. This file would be the master key, unlocking the source input file, defining its properties (CSV, Excel, Parquet, Delta format, you name it), and setting the parameters for reading the data.\nOnce the source dataset was read as a PySpark Dataframe, the configuration file would guide the transformations, validations, and finally, the write command. Now, I know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. This configuration file could potentially become as long as a Tolstoy novel. And you\u0026rsquo;re right.\nI started off with JSON for the configuration file, but it soon started to resemble a plate of spaghetti with all the nested configs. So, I switched to YAML, which made the configuration file a bit more readalbe, if you would as me. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sneak peek into one of the configuration files for a data pipeline.\nsource: dataset_name: Sample Dataset read_path: \u0026lt;path to the file/folder location\u0026gt; read_format: parquet read_options: inferSchema: true transformations: - stage_name: SelectColumnTransformer comment: Selecting only the required columns args: columns: - Country - State - City - Year - Population - stage_name: ColumnTransformer comment: Correct the values in Country Column args: columns: - column: Country expr: \u0026#34;CASE WHEN County = \u0026#39;India\u0026#39; THEN \u0026#39;IND\u0026#39; ELSE Country END\u0026#34; - column: Year expr: \u0026#34;int(Year)\u0026#34; - stage_name: GroupByTransformer comment: Get Aggregated values args: group_by: - Country - State - Year aggregations: Min_Population: column: Population agg: min Max_Population: column: Population agg: max Total_Population: column: Population agg: sum write: file_name: \u0026lt;File Name\u0026gt; file_path: \u0026lt;Path to write\u0026gt; I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but this is pretty in my eyes. It looks prettier in a proper Text Editor as well. And yes, I hear you. This is still a configuration file, and someone has to write these configurations down. But hey, Rome wasn\u0026rsquo;t built in a day. This was just the first step. Once I was happy with the framework, the plan was to work on creating a user-friendly interface with all the bells and whistles.\nI know, I know, I could\u0026rsquo;ve started working on it in parallel. But here\u0026rsquo;s a little secret: I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to create a GUI with drag and drop functionalities.\nA One-Stop-Shop for Data Reading, Transformation, and Writing # This framework is a toolbox, which has each and every tool which is designed to perform a specific task in a given data engineering process. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I envisioned for my Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering Framework.\nData engineering, in its essence, is a series of tasks that can be broken down into smaller functions. Reading a single CSV file or multiple CSV files, reading Excel or Parquet files, fetching data from Microsoft SQL Server or Snowflake - these are all individual tasks. Then come the transformations - selecting columns, grouping by, ordering by, pivoting, unpivoting, filtering, adding or removing columns, and so on. Finally, we have the writing options - outputting the data as CSV, Parquet, Delta, or write to SQL. In my eyes, data engineering is just these steps happening in various permutations and combinations from a desired list.\nSo, I placed each of these small units in a class, which is then called in the main pipeline. This approach has two main advantages:\n1. Extensibility: This is the biggest advantage. Let\u0026rsquo;s say someone wants to add a new functionality. With this framework, it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as adding a new class for that particular functionality. This modular approach makes the system highly adaptable and scalable. It\u0026rsquo;s like playing with Lego blocks - you can keep adding, removing, or rearranging the blocks to create whatever structure you want. The same goes for our data engineering tasks. Need a new transformation function? Just create a new class. Need to read data from a new source? Add a class for that. The possibilities are endless.\n2. Good Coding Practices and Unit Testing: The second benefit is that the data engineer using this framework doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about good coding practices or unit testing - all of that is already taken care of in the framework. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a safety net. The developers just have to focus on writing pipelines and defining validation steps. This significantly reduces the cognitive load on the developers and allows them to focus on what they do best - engineering data.\nNext Chapter # As we turn the page on this chapter, I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to share that our story of building the Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering Framework isn\u0026rsquo;t a tale of fiction. It\u0026rsquo;s a reality, it\u0026rsquo;s tangible, and it\u0026rsquo;s ready to be put into action.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t close the book just yet! We\u0026rsquo;re merely at the end of a chapter, not the whole story. We\u0026rsquo;ve set the scene for a new development workflow and introduced our characters. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time for the plot to thicken.\nIn the next chapter (or rather, the next article), we\u0026rsquo;ll delve deeper into the heart of the narrative. We\u0026rsquo;ll explore the intricacies of the code, the twists and turns of our journey, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. We\u0026rsquo;ll also share the reviews and feedback from the brave team members who\u0026rsquo;ve been using this framework, and see whether this has really democratized data engineering processes or not!\nSo, keep your bookmark ready, sit back, and get ready for the next chapter. What are you most excited to learn about in our journey?\nReferences # Here are some articles that I found extremely helpful in my journey and I hope they will be for you too:\nLow-Code or No-Code: What\u0026rsquo;s the Difference: This blog on IBM\u0026rsquo;s blog provides a comprehensive comparison between low-code and no-code development platforms. It explains how both platforms aim to democratize technology and increase productivity by abstracting complex coding aspects, but they target different user groups and use cases, with low-code offering more customization and scalability for professional developers, while no-code provides a completely hands-off approach suitable for business users and straightforward applications.\nCode vs Low Code vs No Code: When to use each one: This blog on Zapier\u0026rsquo;s blog provides a detailed comparison of full-code, low-code, and no-code platforms, discussing their pros, cons, and ideal use cases. It emphasizes that while full-code allows for ultimate customization, low-code and no-code platforms offer faster, more cost-effective solutions that are easier to maintain and adapt, making them increasingly attractive for businesses looking to streamline development and processes.\nThe Future of Data Engineering is No-Code: This article discusses how the rise of no-code tools is streamlining data engineering processes and driving down costs. It emphasizes that these tools not only enhance agility but also allow team members to participate more actively in development processes, thus breaking the data engineering logjam and fostering efficient and agile data engineering processes.\nNo-code data engineering solutions: This is a lively discussion among data engineers about the pros and cons of no-code and low-code solutions for data engineering tasks. Participants share their experiences with a variety of tools, including SSIS, ADF, and Matillion, and discuss the benefits and limitations of no-code ETL solutions like Stitch. The thread also includes a healthy debate about the practicality and efficiency of these tools, with some users expressing skepticism about their long-term viability and others advocating for their potential to streamline data engineering processes and democratize data handling.\nData Engineering Career Path: To Code or not to Code: This personal blog on Medium discusses the author\u0026rsquo;s personal journey as a Senior Data Engineer and the varying perceptions of Data Engineering roles across different companies. The author notes that many companies view their Data Engineers as an extension of analytics, while others see them as an extension of Software Engineering. The author believes that the divide in the perception of Data Engineering roles has been caused by excellent data platform products from companies like DBT, Snowflake, DataDog, Palantir, and DataBricks. These tools empower SQL-specialists to handle tasks that were previously relegated to Software Engineers or Data Engineers.\n","date":"30 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/nocode-lowcode-part1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the world of Low-Code/No Code Data Engineering.

You know the type - it\u0026rsquo;s 3 AM, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to sleep, and all you can hear is \u0026lsquo;share your work, share your work.\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s like a mantra, a chant, a nagging parent reminding you to clean your room. but instead of dirty laundry, it\u0026rsquo;s all about airing our your knowledge and learning for the world to see.\nI know what you are thinking - \u0026ldquo;That book\u0026rsquo;s been out for years, why are you just now deciding to write about it?\u0026rdquo; Well, I read it couple of months back and I have been meaning to write this article for months now. And let me tell you, it\u0026rsquo;s not for lack of trying. But every time I sat down to write, I\u0026rsquo;d get this nagging feeling like I was about to jump off a high dive. Scary stuff, right? But then, as I was tinkering around with my website (shout out to the Hugo Theme - Winston), I stumbled upon this gem: \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t start out writing good stuff.\u0026rdquo; And I thought, \u0026ldquo;Well, isn\u0026rsquo;t that just the permission slip I needed to dive headfirst into the pool of mediocrity.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, How is the Book? # Kevin Kelly once said, \u0026lsquo;The Internet is a copy machine. Once anything that can be copied is brought into contact with the Internet, it will be copied, and those copies never leave.\u0026rsquo; After reading \u0026lsquo;Show Your Work!\u0026rsquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to think books are getting in on the copy action too. And would you believe it? I stumbled upon Kevin\u0026rsquo;s nugget of wisdom right there in the pages of this very book. It\u0026rsquo;s like a game of intellectual tag, where one book quotes another, which quotes another.\nWhile \u0026lsquo;Show Your Work!\u0026rsquo; may not be the treasure trove of never-before-seen wisdom some might have hoped for, it does something arguably more valuable. It takes those scattered pearls of wisdom we\u0026rsquo;ve all stumbled upon at some point of our lives and weaves them into a compelling read. Austin Kleon, doesn\u0026rsquo;t just present these ideas; he nudges, and sometimes outright shoves you towards action. He encourages you to take your work, whatever it may be, and share it with the world. He wants you to doodle a stick figure fighting the lamest war on a paper napkin during lunch and post it on Instagram with a hashtag #NapkinArt. He wants your to write the crappiest piece of code, then kind that would make a seasoned developer cry, and just push it on an Open Source Project on GitHub. He\u0026rsquo;d probably cheer you on if you recorded a tuneless rendition of \u0026lsquo;Happy birthday\u0026rsquo; on your old, out-of-tune piano and uploaded it to YouTube. Heck, he might even advocate for you to choreograph a dance routine to the sound of your morning alarm and debut it on Insta Reels or TikTok. It\u0026rsquo;s all about putting yourself out there, no matter how messy, imperfect, or downright bizzare your work might be.\nWhat Did I Like About the Book? # There were several standout points that resonated with me, and offered a fresh perspective on how to approach my work. Out of all the ideas, these are summaries of the three most important points I am taking away from this book:\nYou Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Be a Genius # This book debunks the myth of the lone genius. The idea that you have to be a genius to create something of value is not only intimidating but also misleading. In reality, everyone has something unique to offer, and it\u0026rsquo;s about tapping into that potential and sharing it with the world. The book encourages embracing the role of the amateur, the one who loves what they do and is not afraid to experiment, make mistakes, and learn along the way.\nThe concept of \u0026ldquo;Scenius\u0026rdquo; is another powerful idea from the book. It suggests that great ideas are often born from a community of creative individuals. Finding your \u0026ldquo;Scenius\u0026rdquo; means surrounding yourself with like-minded people who can challenge you, inspire you, and help you grow. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing the value of collective intelligence and the power of community in driving creativity and innovation.\nThink About the Process and Share Something Small Everyday # Austin places a strong emphasis on the process rather than the final product. And not Austin, several gurus in the industry does emphasise on the process. Documenting and sharing your process can be a powerful tool for learning and growth. It allows you to reflect on your progress, gain valuable feedback, and connect with others who might be on a similar journey.\nThe idea of sharing something small every day is a practical way of putting this into action. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a finished product or a groundbreaking idea. It could be a snippet of code, a sketch, a thought, or a question. The act of sharing regularly not only helps you maintain momentum but also allows others to see and engage with your work in progress.\nOpen up Your Can of Curiosities # This means sharing your interests, your inspirations, and the things that make you tick. It\u0026rsquo;s about letting people see what excites you, what you\u0026rsquo;re passionate about, and what influences your work. This can create a deeper connection with your audience and can also inspire others to explore their own curiosities.\nHoarding knowledge or ideas can stifle creativity and prevent the free flow of information that is so crucial in a creative community. By sharing what you know and learn, you\u0026rsquo;re contributing to the collective knowledge of your \u0026ldquo;Scenius\u0026rdquo; and creating a culture of generosity and collaboration.\nConclusion # Despite its lack of groundbreaking revelations, I\u0026rsquo;d still give \u0026lsquo;Show Your Work!\u0026rsquo; a hearty thumbs up. Why? Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just tell you to create an online presence, it makes a compelling case for why you should. It\u0026rsquo;s a book that deserves at least one read-through, because if you let it, it can shift your perspective and maybe, just maybe, inspire you to take that leap into the digital unknown.\n","date":"19 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/show-your-work/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Let me get one thing straight - Austin Kleon\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Show Your Work!\u0026rsquo; has been rattling around in my brain like a catchy pop song for months now.
