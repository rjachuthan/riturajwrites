Let's dive into the world of Low-Code/No Code Data Engineering. But before we
do, let's set the stage with a bit of context.

Data engineering, in its traditional form, is a complex and intricate process.
It involves creating and maintenaning architectures, databases, and
processing systems that deal with vast amounts of data. Think of Data Engineers
as the architects of data. They build pipelines that transform and transport
data into a format that can be used by data scientists. They are the ones who
make sure that the data is clean, reliable, and prepped for analysis. But this
process is often time-consuming and requires a high level of technical
expertise.

Enter [Low-Code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low-code_development_platform)
[No-Code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/No-code_development_platform) Data
Engineering. I believe that this approach can simplify the process of data
integration and processing. It allows individuals without a deep technical
background to build and manage data pipelines. With a no-code platform, you can
design your data workflows visually and automate the data pipeline without
writing a single line of code. It's like having a magic wand that turns complex
data tasks into a series of simple, intuitive steps.

Now, you might be wondering why I, a humble blogger, decided to embark on the
journey of creating a No Code Data Engineering platform. Well, it's simple. I
saw the challenges that traditional data engineering posed and I wanted to make
a difference. I wanted to make data engineering accessible to all. But, as with
all great endeavors, there were bumps along the road. I faced failures and there
were times when I wanted to throw in the towel. But every failure was a lesson
learned and every setback, a stepping stone towards progress.

# Why Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering?

## Why is the Industry Moving Towards Low-Code/No-Code Approach for Data Engineering?

Firstly, let's talk about the **Democratization of technology**. Both low-code
and no-code solutions are built with the objective of empowering different kinds
of users. As [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/low-code-vs-no-code) puts it,
these platforms are designed to make technology accessible to a wider audience,
not just those with extensive coding skills. The importance of democratizing
technology lies in its potential to foster widespread innovation, creativity,
and problem-solving capabilities. By breaking down the barriers of technical
complexity, these platforms enable a more diverse pool of minds to engage in
technological exploration. A Javascript Developer, a newbie IT Analyst, and
individuals with non-technical backgrounds can now actively contribute to the
development of innovative solutions without the need for extensive coding
knowledge. This democratization nurtures a culture of collaboration and
inclusivity, where ideas from various perspectives converge, leading to the
emergence of novel applications and cutting-edge advancements. This shift is
breaking down barriers between technical and non-technical personnel. I've
always held the belief that a product cannot truly succeed unless business users
take an active interest in their IT solutions. In the context of data
engineering, this perspective becomes even more crucial.

Another reason for choosing a low-code/no-code platform is the **speed and
efficiency** it offers. As
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/low-code-vs-no-code/) points out, no-code
development is the fastest way to build and create solutions. It's also the most
cost-effective and easiest to maintain over time. Using this framework which we
have built, one of our junior developer has really outpaced his development
times. He has been delivering pipelines at a phenomenal speed.

### My Reasons for Moving to Low-Code/No-Code Setup

Imagine you're part of a relay race. You're running at breakneck speed, passing
the baton, and just when you think you're about to cross the finish line, you're
told to run the race again, but this time, backwards. That's what it feels like
working in our fast-paced environment. We're juggling data gathering,
exploratory data analysis, machine learning model creation, and oh, did I
mention, we're also expected to whip up a high-quality data pipeline in the same
breath? No extensions. It's like being asked to bake a cake while simultaneously
performing a ballet. And guess what? 80-90% of our time is spent on tasks that
have nothing to do with data engineering.

In the midst of this whirlwind, we often find ourselves creating what I like to
call the 'Frankenstein's Monster' of code. It's either a '[God
Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object)', a class that's bitten off
more than it can chew, a '[Spaghetti
Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)', a tangled mess that's as
flexible as a brick, or a big '[Ball of
Mud](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ball_of_Mud)', a code so convoluted that
even Sherlock Holmes would have a hard time deciphering it. And these aren't
just fancy terms I'm throwing around; they're real [Anti-Design
Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) that haunt our
deliverables.

Now, let's talk about the wild west of **coding styles** in our company.
Everyone's a cowboy, riding their own horse, following their own trail. It's
like trying to understand an orchestra where every musician is playing a
different tune. It's a nightmare for our Lead Engineers and Architects who have
to review these 'masterpieces'.

And then there's the issue of **standardization**, or rather, the lack of it.
It's like everyone's cooking their own version of a classic recipe. Take '[Base
Price](https://analyticsstudent.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/baseline-sales-for-marketing-mix-modeling/)'
in Media/Marketing Mix Modeling, for example. You'd think it's a standard
calculation, right? Wrong. Every team has their own secret sauce, which works
great for their dish but falls flat in others.

Lastly, let's not forget the elephant in the room - **good coding practices**.
Or in our case, the lack thereof. It's like everyone's so busy juggling, they've
forgotten to check if the balls they're juggling are even round. **Unit
testing**? What's that? We're so caught up in writing functions for specific
tasks that we've forgotten to make them reusable, let alone testable.

So, these are my main pain points. It's a wild ride, but hey, who said data
engineering was going to be a walk in the park? I would really like to have a
Clean Code book just for Data Engineering/Data Science.

	- The author believes that the divide in the perception of Data Engineering roles has been caused by excellent data platform products from companies like DBT, Snowflake, DataDog, Palantir, and DataBricks. These tools empower SQL-specialists to handle tasks that were previously relegated to Software Engineers or Data Engineers.
