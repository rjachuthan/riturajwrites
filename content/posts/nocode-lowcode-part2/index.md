In our inaugural exploration ([Part 1](/posts/nocode_lowcode_part1/)), we
embarked on a journey, diving into the foundational aspects and transformative
potential of a Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering approach. As we venture deeper
in Part 2, we'll unravel the intricacies of the No-Code Data Engineering
framework, shedding light on its robust architecture and configuration-driven
design. We briefly touched upon how this framework has potential to democratize
data engineering , making it accessible to both technical maestros and novices
alike. As we forge ahead in Part 2, our expedition delves deeper, unraveling the
layers that constitute the Low-Code/No-Code Data Engineering realm.

The framework's robust architecture is really simple. Built on principles of
Configuration-Driven Design, it is crafted to be malleable, catering to varied
data needs while ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the data pipeline. The
paradigm of No-Code/Low-Code Data Engineering is not merely about the absence of
coding; it's about optimizing processes, streamlining workflows, and, most
importantly, bridging the chasm between technical and non-technical users. This
is where its user-friendly interface will shine, acting as a beacon for those
venturing into data realms previously deemed insurmountable without a coding
background.

Platforms like reddit have become hotbeds of discussions, teeming with
enthusiasts and skeptics alike, dissecting the merits and challenges of data
engineering sans the traditional coding rigmarole **[TODO: Add links supporting
this]**. But what truly sets this platform and software apart? Beyond the
surface-level allure of simplicity, this platforms harbor intricate mechanisms.
From extensible data pipelines that ensure seamless data transformation to the
embedded good coding practices ensuring the system's reliability, the depth of
this framework is astounding.

Since the logic of the data pipelines has been already wrapped in neatly
packaged classes and have already been unit tested thoroughly, the significance
of unit testing in traditional frameworks becomes less pressing in this No-Code
paradigm. Developers no longer have to invest extra time in unit testing on
their end. Ensuring that every module functions as intended, that every cog in
the machine runs smoothly, becomes a given. This not only streamlines the
development process but also provides assurance of the system's reliability. Add
to this the principle of extensibility, and you have a framework that is not
only robust at its core but also adaptable, ready to evolve with the
ever-changing data landscape, giving developers more time to engineer effective
solutions.

Whether you're a seasoned data engineer, a budding enthusiast, or someone merely
intrigued by the buzz surrounding low code platforms or no code platforms, this
exploration promises insights and revelations. As we navigate through the
intricacies of the framework, from its architecture to its operational nuances,
join us in discovering the future of data engineering—a future where complexity
is tamed, and innovation thrives.

## The Architecture

Let me explain how I came up with the Architecture of this framework.

### Framework Architecture - The Ideation

When embarking on the journey to design a robust data engineering framework,
it's crucial to lay a strong architectural foundation. Let's delve into the
intricate architecture of our No-Code/Low-Code Data Engineering framework.

#### 1. Data Assumptions and Environment

The framework operates on a fundamental assumption: the data you're processing
is already within your working environment. In the context of my organization:

- Primarily, our data resides in **Azure Datalake** or **Azure SQL Server**.
  These platforms cater to over 90% of our team's use cases. However, the beauty
  of this framework is its extensibility. Theoretically, it can integrate with
  any service accessible via Azure Databricks, as our pipelines execute within
  this environment.
- Post-processing, we typically store datasets within the Azure ecosystem.
  Whether it's Azure Datalake or Azure SQL Server, these platforms seamlessly
  integrate with our frontend applications.
- Our design philosophy revolves around the **Lakehouse** model. We've adopted
  the **Medallion Architecture** for data storage. Here's a snapshot: One team
  pushes data into a `RAW` folder. From there, data transitions to the `PROCESS`
  folder, and finally, it finds its resting place in the `OUTPUT` folder.

#### 2. The Three Pillars: Read, Transform, Write

Upon a closer inspection of our data pipelines, a pattern emerges. Regardless of
the complexities and nuances, at their core, these pipelines revolve around
three primary stages: Reading, Transforming, and Writing data.

- The sequence of these stages can vary. For instance, the ETL (Extract,
  Transform, Load) process follows a Read-Transform-Write sequence. In contrast,
  ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) involves Reading, Writing, then Transforming,
  followed by another Write operation. Some specialized pipelines might even
  adopt a Read-Transform-Write (for rejected datasets)-Write (for final
  datasets) sequence.
- With these diverse scenarios in mind, and anticipating future variations, I
  encapsulated the dataset representation within a Python Class named
  `SparkDataset`. This class serves as the backbone of our data operations. As
  for the pipeline representation, it's elegantly captured using dedicated
  classes like `ETL`, `ELT`, and others, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

### Diving Deeper - `SparkDataset` Class

Having explored the foundational layer of our framework's architecture, it's
time to delve into the second layer, where the magic truly happens - the
`SparkDataset` class.

#### 1. Core Functions of `SparkDataset`

The `SparkDataset` class is elegantly simple, yet powerful, comprising just
three primary functions:

- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: He we prepare the `SparkSession` object,
  ensuring we're ready to dive into data operations.
- **Reading (`read()`)**: As the name suggests, this function is all about
  ingesting data, reading it into a PySpark dataframe.
- **Transformation (`transform()`)**: This is where the data undergoes
  metamorphosis. Based on the configurations specified, this function applies a
  series of transformations to shape the data as required.
- **Writing (`write()`)**: The final act. Once the data is processed and
  refined, this function ensures it's written to the desired destination.

#### 2. The Flexibility Factor

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The true versatility of the
`SparkDataset` class lies in its adaptability:

- **Diverse Data Formats**: Our data sources are as varied as they come. From
  CSV, parquet, and delta formats to the occasional Excel file (though we're not
  big fans), and even datasets housed in Azure SQL Server. The class gracefully
  handles these varied formats.
- **Writing Capabilities**: Similarly, when it comes to data output, whether
  you're looking to write data as parquet, delta, or load it into Azure SQL
  Server, `SparkDataset` has got you covered.
- **Limitless Transformations**: The sky's the limit when it comes to data
  transformations. Whether you're applying just one or a whopping fifty
  transformations, the class handles it with ease.

#### 3. The Extensibility Enigma

I've often emphasized the extensibility of this framework. But how did we
achieve this without compromising on functionality? The secret sauce lies in the
design of the `SparkDataset` class. Instead of embedding specific logics for
reading, writing, or transforming data within the class, we've externalized them
into separate classes. Through the power of [[Class Composition]], we plug in
the necessary classes based on the use case. Here's a glimpse of how we can
instantiate a `SparkDataset` object:

```python
dataset = SparkDataset(config="some_config.yaml")
dataset.read(reader=SQLServerReader)
dataset.transform(transformation_key="transformation")
dataset.write(writer=DataLakeWriter)`
```

With this approach, you can effortlessly swap out classes for reading and
writing. And given that multiple transformations are often the norm, we pass a
LIST of Transformations defined in the configuration file (like
"some_config.yaml").

#### 4. User-Driven Evolution

One of the core tenets of our framework is its **adaptability**. We envisioned a
system that's not just robust in its current form but is also malleable enough
to **evolve** with the ever-changing landscape of data engineering.

Imagine a scenario where a user, perhaps from a different team or even a
different organization, has a unique requirement. Let's say they need to read
data from Postgres SQL. Instead of waiting for the original developers to update
the framework or resorting to cumbersome workarounds, they should be able to
seamlessly integrate this new functionality. The same principle applies to
transformations and data writing.

To achieve this level of flexibility, we needed a well-thought-out approach. The
answer lay in one of the foundational design patterns in software engineering -
the [[Strategy Design Pattern]]. By leveraging this pattern, we've created a
framework where functionalities can be extended or swapped without altering the
existing codebase. It's like adding new tools to a Swiss Army knife; each tool
(or strategy) is independent but integrates perfectly with the overall
mechanism.

### Decoding the Reader and Writer Classes

The beauty of our framework lies in its simplicity and structure. By using the
Strategy Design Pattern, we've ensured that adding new functionalities or
tweaking existing ones is a breeze. Let's delve deeper into how this is
achieved, particularly for our Reader classes. (And remember, the same logic
applies to our Writer classes too!) The Blueprint: Abstract Reader Class

At the heart of our Reader functionality is an abstract class, which essentially
serves as a blueprint for all subsequent Reader classes. This abstract class,
DataReader, doesn't perform any operations by itself. Instead, it lays down a
set of rules or protocols that every Reader class must adhere to.

Here's a peek into its structure:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, DataFrame

class DataReader(ABC):

	def __init__(self, spark: SparkSession) -> None:
		self.spark = spark

	@abstractmethod
	def read(self, input_path: str, input_format: str, options: dict[str, Any]) -> DataFrame:
		raise NotImplementedError()
```

The `DataReader` class mandates two primary features for all its child classes:

1. **Configuration Options**: Accept configuration parameters from the config
   file.
2. **Data Reading Function**: A function that reads data and returns a Spark
   DataFrame object.

#### DataReader In Action: `DataLakeReader`

Building upon the foundation laid by the `DataReader` class, let's look at a
concrete implementation: the `DataLakeReader` class.

```python
class DataLakeReader(DataReader):

	def read(self, input_path: str, input_file_type: str, file_read_options: dict[str, Any], **kwargs) -> DataFrame:
		try:
			df_data = (
				self.spark.read
				.format(input_file_type)
				.options(**file_read_options)
				.load(input_path)
			)
			return df_data
		except Exception as err:
			raise FileReadException(f"Error occurred while reading the file: {err}")
```

This class, while adhering to the protocols of the abstract class, provides a
specific implementation for reading data from a data lake. It's designed to be
robust, handling potential errors gracefully.

#### Writers: A Mirror Reflection

The Writer classes follow a similar structure. At their core, they have an
abstract class that defines the rules. Each specific Writer class then provides
its unique implementation, ensuring data is written seamlessly to the desired
destination.
